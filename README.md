# iOS-Portfolio
2018-2019 Portfolio
Throughout my time in iOS Development I worked both individually and as a member of a team. My first app was called Schwifty Slots and was a simple randomization app written in swift. My second project which took up most of my class time was the EPHS Student Handbook. This was a collaboration of 5 of my classmates in order to design an app for students at our high school. We self-learned all of the code and customization that we added to the app.

  This was the first project that I worked on in iOS development. The goal being to gain a basic understanding of the mechanics of Swift as well as the creation possibilities that XCode offers. The main premis is a slot machine randomization game in which the functions change based on a user made decision.

  This Project was the pinnacle of my CS learning so far at EPHS. It contains many functions that we designed as a team to match the needs of students. The main style that we used were Collection Views that pulled information from a "MyPHPAdmin" Database. These allowed us to impliment the information in the most accessible way possible. One useful feature that XCode helped us use was Navigation Bars as well as Tab Bars. These helped users navigate the app as easily as we intended it. The app is currently in the App Store and we continue to come up with new and exciting features to release to our fellow students!
  
  The environment created in iOS Development has given me the tools and basic knowledge to create functioning as well as innovative apps. I continue to stretch myself every day to learn or accomplish something new in the world of Swift.
