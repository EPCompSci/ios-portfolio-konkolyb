# iOS-Portfolio
2018-2019 Portfolio

Using this space as the home base for your portfolio, make a wiki or pages like this read me to highlight what you have learned / created over this semester of class. You should consider this as much for your grade as your resume. You've got incredible work to highlight and brag about - do that here. 

I'd like you to consider this assignment as a way to get a job / internship / independent contract with someone outside the school.

Create links to group projects (create a new repo for completed apps) you've been working on, making sure the read me's have details about what the apps do in the format the app store asks - look at a couple apps to see what I'm talking about. Don't forget about those first simple apps you created - they still matter!

Throughout my time in iOS development I worked both individually and as a member of a team. My first app was called Schwifty Slots and was a simple randomization app written in swift. My second project which took up most of my class time was the EPHS Student Handbook. This was a collaboration of 5 of my classmates in order to design an app for students at our high school. We self-learned all of the code and customization that we added to the app.

  This was the first project that I worked on in iOS development. The goal being to gain a basic understanding of the mechanics of Swift as well as the creation possibilities that XCode offers. The main premis is a slot machine randomization game in which the functions change based on a user made decision.
